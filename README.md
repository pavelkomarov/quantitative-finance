This is meant to eventually house a few things:

- Basic, clean technical analysis scripts complete with header comments about how to use them (full data pipeline)
- Trading strategies, some from ML for Trading, some common knowledge, some to be invented, implemented where possible as runnable Jupyter notebooks with explanations.
  - A basic classification strategy to decide purely whether something will go up or down on a daily basis, utilizing data of equities themselves, their siblings, and any other daily data streams we can think of.
  - A set of runnable, backtestable market-cycle timing strategies.
  - That order-book noise high frequency trader Vikram and I talked about making, to be plugged in to pro.coinbase.com.
  - That mean-variance ?? trading strategy I implemented on a whim a couple years ago, beyond the extra credit.
  - A reinforcement-learning based approach.
  - Research in to quantification of options risk/valuation strategies.
- A set of supporting objects and utilities (a "framework") for to make the above goals coherent.
