This is meant to eventually house a few things:

- Basic, clean technical analysis scripts complete with header comments about how to use them (full data pipeline)
- Trading strategies, some from ML for Trading, some common knowledge, some to be invented, implemented where possible as runnable Jupyter notebooks with explanations and instructions.
  - A basic classification strategy to decide purely whether something will go up or down on a daily basis, utilizing data of equities themselves, their siblings, and any other daily data streams we can think of.
  - A set of runnable, backtestable market-cycle timing strategies.
  - That order-book noise high frequency trader Vikram and I talked about making, to be plugged in to pro.coinbase.com.
  - That mean-variance ?? trading strategy I implemented on a whim a couple years ago, beyond the extra credit.
  - A reinforcement-learning based approach.
  - Research in to quantification of options risk/valuation strategies.
  - An options strategy that finds bargains by looking for odd-ones-out of sorted price order.
  - An LSTM-based prediction model, to get more intuition about recurrent nets.
- A set of supporting objects and utilities (a "framework") for to make the above goals coherent.

Specific Todo items will live in the comments of relevant files and in the readmes of subfolders. I'll organize specific high-priority goals for each new release here at the top level.

Todo for version 0.1:
  - upload projects from ML for trading, and organize
